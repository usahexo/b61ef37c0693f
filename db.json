fever?\n\nCartoons are movies that are animated and sometimes they are based on comics or graphic novels. They can be produced by using traditional animation techniques, CGI or a combination of both. Cartoons are often considered to be family-friendly films and they can be enjoyed by both children and adults alike.\n\nThere are many different types of cartoons and the list below showcases some of the best examples of this genre. Whether you want to watch an action-packed adventure or a comedy film, there is something for everyone on this list. So, if you’re looking for your next animated movie fix, then check out these 15 great cartoon movies.\n\n1. The Incredibles\n\nThis 2004 film is about a family of superheroes who must deal with the everyday challenges of life as well as fighting evil villains. The Incredibles was a box office success and it received critical acclaim from movie critics.\n\n2. Toy Story\n\nThis 1995 classic is the first feature-length computer-animated film and it follows the adventures of Woody the cowboy and Buzz Lightyear the space ranger. Toy Story was nominated for three Academy Awards and it became a smash hit with audiences around the world.\n\n3. Shrek\n\nThis 2001 movie tells the story of an ogre who goes on a journey to rescue a princess from a dragon-guarded tower. Shrek was a critical and commercial success, winning two Academy Awards in 2002.\n\n4. WALL-E\n\nThis 2008 film tells the story of a robot who falls in love with another robot and they must save humanity from their own destruction. WALL-E was praised by movie critics and it won numerous awards, including two Academy Awards nominations.\n\n#  Why are these particular films chosen?\n\nWhat follows is a list of what we believe to be the 10 best war films ever made. This was not an easy decision to make, as there are so many great war movies out there. However, after much deliberation we have come up with what we feel are the essential titles that everyone should see.\n\nOne of the reasons these particular films were chosen is because they show different aspects of war. Some focus on the battlefield, while others explore the impact on those back home. Regardless, each one offers a unique and unforgettable experience.\n\n# 1 - Saving Private Ryan\n\nThis 1998 classic by Steven Spielberg is undoubtedly one of the most iconic war movies ever made. Set during the Normandy Invasion in World War II, it tells the story of a group of soldiers who are sent to find and rescue a paratrooper who has been separated from his unit.\n\nThe film is renowned for its incredible realism and grisly violence, which has resulted in it being frequently cited as one of the most accurate portrayals of war ever committed to screen. It's also worth noting that Spielberg shot much of the footage himself, using actual veterans as extras, lending the film an unparalleled sense of authenticity.\n\n# 2 - The Thin Red Line\n\nThis 1998 drama by Terrence Malick tells the story of American soldiers fighting in Guadalcanal during World War II. The film was met with mixed reviews upon release, but has since gained a reputation as one of the greatest war movies ever made.\n\nMuch like Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line features stunning visuals and visceral combat sequences. However, it also explores the psychological toll that war takes on soldiers, offering a more nuanced portrait of warfare than many other titles on this list.\n\n# 3 - Apocalypse Now\n\nThis 1979 Vietnam War epic by Francis Ford Coppola is widely considered to be one of the greatest American films ever made. It tells the story of Capt. Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen), who is sent on a dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando).\n\nApocalypse Now is famous for its disorienting and hallucinatory style, which perfectly captures the chaotic nature of war. It's also known for its excellent cast, which includes Brando, Sheen, Robert Duvall, and Laurence Fishburne in his breakout role.\n\n#  How do these films make you feel?\n\nMovies are a great way to escape the stresses of life. They can take you on a journey to a different world or time. But what is it about these films that affect us so strongly?\n\nFilms are designed to evoke an emotional response from viewers. Whether it’s happiness, sadness, fear or anger, filmmakers know how to play on our emotions. In order to achieve this, they use certain techniques such as music, lighting and editing.\n\nMusic is one of the most powerful tools in a filmmaker’s arsenal. It can be used to set the tone for a scene or to manipulate our emotions. For example, if the composer wants to make us feel scared, they might use spooky music or ominous chords.\n\nLighting is another important tool. By using shadows and darkness, filmmakers can create an eerie atmosphere or make objects seem more ominous. Editing is another effective way of manipulating our emotions. Fast cuts and jump scares are commonly used in horror movies in order to make us feel scared or anxious.\n\nSo why do these films make us feel so strongly? The answer is simple – because that’s what they’re meant to do. Filmmakers use clever techniques to evoke emotion in their viewers, and it’s an effective way of immersing us in their storyworlds.\n\n#  What is your favorite film on the list? \n\nThere are so many great films on this list, but if I had to choose just one it would have to be \"The Shawshank Redemption\". It's a timeless film that never gets old, and Andy's journey from prisoner to free man is one that is both touching and inspiring.\n\n#  What would you say to someone who has never watched an animated film before?\n\nTo someone who has never watched an animated film before, I would say that they are in for a treat. Animated films are a great way to escape reality and enter into a new and imaginative world. Animated films can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and there is something for everyone. Whether you are looking for a funny film or a heartfelt film, there is sure to be an animated film that fits the bill.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-top-15-Cartoon-Films-that-will-give-you-the-animated-movie-fever.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the top 15 Cartoon Films that will give you the animated movie fever\ndate: 2022-09-08 18:29:59\ncategories:\n- Cartoon Animation\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What are the top 15 Cartoon Films that will give you the animated movie fever?\n\nCartoons are movies that are animated and sometimes they are based on comics or graphic novels.
