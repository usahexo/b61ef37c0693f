#  Starbucks bingo helps Haiti relief efforts

In early February, Starbucks announced that it was teaming up with the game company Zynga to create a new mobile game, Starbucks Bingo. For every person who downloads the game, Starbucks and Zynga will donate $1 to the charity Feeding America. The goal is to raise $250,000 for Haiti relief efforts.

The game is available for free on both Apple and Android devices. It can be played alone or with friends, and there are different levels of difficulty to choose from. When you play, you’ll see a selection of coffees, pastries, and other items from the Starbucks menu. You must then mark off those items on your bingo card as they are called out.

The game is already proving popular; within 24 hours of its release, it had been downloaded more than 1 million times. And with Starbucks pledging to match every dollar donated by players, it’s hoped that the total raised for Feeding America will be considerable.

This isn’t the first time that Starbucks has partnered with Zynga for charity purposes. In December 2017, the two companies teamed up to create a “Cheer for Good” campaign, which raised money for the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

Starbucks has long been involved in charitable work. In 2018, it announced that it would be making a $20 million investment in creating better opportunities for young people around the world. This includes giving employees access to education and vocational training programs, as well as increasing its support of refugee relief programs.

#  Playing Starbucks bingo with your partner is a great way to help Haiti

The coffee chain Starbucks has come up with a new way to help Haiti. It's called Starbucks Bingo.

Here's how it works: You and your partner each pick five Starbucks drinks. Then, you take turns guessing which drink the other person will order next. If you're correct, then you get a bingo!

Not only is this a fun game to play with your partner, but it also helps raise money for Haiti. For every bingo that's played, Starbucks will donate $1 to charity: water, a nonprofit organization that brings clean and safe drinking water to people in developing countries.

So why not give Starbucks Bingo a try? It's a fun way to help out a good cause and maybe even win some free coffee in the process!

#  Starbucks bingo supports the people of Haiti

Starbucks bingo is a new game that supports the people of Haiti. For every purchase of a bingo card, Starbucks will donate $1 to Haitian relief efforts.

The game is simple: match any of the 24 words listed on your card to one of the 12 pictures provided. There are four corners, four edges, and four middle squares on the card, for a total of 16 opportunities to win.

As an added bonus, customers can also receive a free coffee or food item from Starbucks for every eight cards they purchase. This promotion runs from January 18th to February 7th.

Starbucks has been a longtime supporter of Haiti, providing relief and rebuilding efforts in the wake of the devastating 2010 earthquake. The company has donated more than $30 million to Haiti since then.
