The 2016 World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is set to run from September 17-October 7 at the King’s Casino Rozvadov in Czech Republic. The online poker giant PokerStars has announced that it will be sponsoring and dealing the action in Event #1: €1,100 No Limit Hold’em.

#  PokerStars Plans to Deal Millions of Hands in October

PokerStars officials announced on Wednesday that the world’s largest online poker site plans to deal an astounding 25 million hands during October.

That figure is a far cry from the site’s busiest month on record, which took place in March of this year when PokerStars dealt just over 14 million hands.

What’s behind the sudden surge in action? Officials believe that it has to do with the upcoming World Series of Poker, which kicks off next week at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

“With the WSOP right around the corner, we expect a lot of players will be turning to PokerStars to get their fill of big-money tournament action,” said PokerStars spokesperson Anastasia Danelyan.

Indeed, many of the most prestigious events on the WSOP schedule – including the $10,000 Main Event – will take place in the latter half of July and early August. That should provide plenty of incentive for players from all over the world to fire up their PokerStars accounts and log some serious volume.

In anticipation of the increased traffic, PokerStars has beefed up its software infrastructure by adding additional servers and increasing its pool of manpower. The site is also offering a range of promotions and bonuses specifically geared towards WSOP participants.

Among other things, PokerStars is running a series of ‘challenges’ that award prizes worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars to players who achieve specific goals such as winning a certain number of hands or reaching a certain final table stage. There are also reload bonuses available for those looking to add some extra funds to their bankrolls.
