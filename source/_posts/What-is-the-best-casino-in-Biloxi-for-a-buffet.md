#  What Brooklyn Nets players have the best buffet game?

In the NBA, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. But when you’re playing for the Brooklyn Nets, there might as well be.

While most teams have a couple of players that can feast at the buffet line, the Brooklyn Nets have several. Let’s take a look at who has the best buffet game on the team.

Joe Harris

Joe Harris is one of the best players in the NBA at getting to the free throw line. But he’s also one of the best players in the league at getting to the buffet line. Harris is always one of the first players off of the bench and he usually goes straight for the buffet. He’s got a great combination of size and speed that allows him to get past defenders and into prime position to eat.

D'Angelo Russell

D’Angelo Russell is another player that loves to get to the buffet line. He’s not quite as aggressive as Harris, but he still manages to get his share of points by attacking the basket. What makes Russell even more dangerous is his ability to knock down shots from outside. That makes it difficult for defenders to stay close to him, which opens up more opportunities for him to get to the buffet line.

Allen Crabbe

Allen Crabbe is one of those players that doesn’t always get a lot of attention, but he can still be dangerous on offense. He has a good mix of size and speed that allows him to take advantage of smaller defenders and get into good position for shots or dunks. And like Harris and Russell, Crabbe is also very effective at drawing fouls, which gives him even more opportunities to stuff his face at the buffet line.
