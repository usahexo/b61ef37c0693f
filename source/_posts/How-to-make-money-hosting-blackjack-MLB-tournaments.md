This is something that will vary depending on the size of your casino, as well as the number of players that you expect to participate. In general, you’ll want to have a higher buy-in for larger tournaments, with payouts that reflect that. You can also choose to have different payout structures for different rounds or levels of the tournament.

2. Create league standings.

Not only does this add an extra layer of excitement for players, but it also allows you to rank them according to their performance. This can be helpful in determining who advances to the next round or receives a prize.

3. Draft your players.

In order to make things fair, it’s a good idea to draft players randomly rather than allowing them all to pick their own teams. This can be done with a simple hat draw or using a random number generator online.

4. Promote your tournament!

Make sure you spread the word about your upcoming tournament by using social media, your website, and even traditional advertising methods like flyers and posters. The more people know about it, the more likely they are to participate!
