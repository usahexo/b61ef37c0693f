#  Why are these particular films chosen?

What follows is a list of what we believe to be the 10 best war films ever made. This was not an easy decision to make, as there are so many great war movies out there. However, after much deliberation we have come up with what we feel are the essential titles that everyone should see.

One of the reasons these particular films were chosen is because they show different aspects of war. Some focus on the battlefield, while others explore the impact on those back home. Regardless, each one offers a unique and unforgettable experience.

# 1 - Saving Private Ryan

This 1998 classic by Steven Spielberg is undoubtedly one of the most iconic war movies ever made. Set during the Normandy Invasion in World War II, it tells the story of a group of soldiers who are sent to find and rescue a paratrooper who has been separated from his unit.

The film is renowned for its incredible realism and grisly violence, which has resulted in it being frequently cited as one of the most accurate portrayals of war ever committed to screen. It's also worth noting that Spielberg shot much of the footage himself, using actual veterans as extras, lending the film an unparalleled sense of authenticity.

# 2 - The Thin Red Line

This 1998 drama by Terrence Malick tells the story of American soldiers fighting in Guadalcanal during World War II. The film was met with mixed reviews upon release, but has since gained a reputation as one of the greatest war movies ever made.

Much like Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line features stunning visuals and visceral combat sequences. However, it also explores the psychological toll that war takes on soldiers, offering a more nuanced portrait of warfare than many other titles on this list.

# 3 - Apocalypse Now

This 1979 Vietnam War epic by Francis Ford Coppola is widely considered to be one of the greatest American films ever made. It tells the story of Capt. Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen), who is sent on a dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando).

Apocalypse Now is famous for its disorienting and hallucinatory style, which perfectly captures the chaotic nature of war. It's also known for its excellent cast, which includes Brando, Sheen, Robert Duvall, and Laurence Fishburne in his breakout role.

#  How do these films make you feel?

Movies are a great way to escape the stresses of life. They can take you on a journey to a different world or time. But what is it about these films that affect us so strongly?

Films are designed to evoke an emotional response from viewers. Whether it’s happiness, sadness, fear or anger, filmmakers know how to play on our emotions. In order to achieve this, they use certain techniques such as music, lighting and editing.

Music is one of the most powerful tools in a filmmaker’s arsenal. It can be used to set the tone for a scene or to manipulate our emotions. For example, if the composer wants to make us feel scared, they might use spooky music or ominous chords.

Lighting is another important tool. By using shadows and darkness, filmmakers can create an eerie atmosphere or make objects seem more ominous. Editing is another effective way of manipulating our emotions. Fast cuts and jump scares are commonly used in horror movies in order to make us feel scared or anxious.

So why do these films make us feel so strongly? The answer is simple – because that’s what they’re meant to do. Filmmakers use clever techniques to evoke emotion in their viewers, and it’s an effective way of immersing us in their storyworlds.

#  What is your favorite film on the list? 

There are so many great films on this list, but if I had to choose just one it would have to be "The Shawshank Redemption". It's a timeless film that never gets old, and Andy's journey from prisoner to free man is one that is both touching and inspiring.

#  What would you say to someone who has never watched an animated film before?
