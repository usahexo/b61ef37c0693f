#  Delaware Becomes First State To Legalize Online Gambling

Beginning on Tuesday, May 1, 2018, residents in Delaware will be able to enjoy legalized online gambling. This makes Delaware the first state in the US to offer this type of gaming option. The new law allows for both casino games and sports betting to be enjoyed from the comfort of oneâ€™s own home.

Up until this point, Delaware has only allowed brick-and-mortar casinos within the state. The hope is that this new online option will bring in more revenue for the state. It is estimated that over $9 million was wagered illegally on sports in Delaware last year, so there is certainly potential for growth.

There are some restrictions associated with the new law. First and foremost, you must be 18 years of age or older to participate. Additionally, you must be a resident of Delaware in order to gamble online. Finally, players must login to websites using their official state ID number.

At this point, it is not clear exactly how many websites will offer online gambling options in Delaware. However, it is safe to assume that the major players such as PokerStars, 888poker, and PartyPoker will be among those who jump on board. Fans of casino games such as blackjack and roulette will also have plenty of choices when it comes to sites.

It remains to be seen how successful the new law will be in Delaware. However, with other states likely to follow suit, it seems likely that online gambling will become increasingly popular in the coming years.

#  Nevada to soon follow suit, allow gambling online

Gambling online is coming to a state near you.

Nevada officials have announced that they will be following in the footsteps of their neighbor, New Jersey, and legalizing gambling on the internet.

This move is seen as a way to help revive the state's struggling casino industry.

Governor Brian Sandoval made the announcement on Tuesday, saying that he had signed a bill into law that would allow people in Nevada to gamble online.

"The opportunity to bring millions of new players to our casinos and generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue is a game changer for Nevada," said Sandoval.

The law will come into effect in January of 2013.

#  Online casino gambling now legal in the US!

Wow! Just wow!

Online casino gambling is now legal in the United States of America! This is huge news for both casino gamers and the industry as a whole. The landmark decision came down from the Supreme Court on Monday, May 14th and opens up the floodgates for online casino gaming in states across the nation.

While it's still unclear exactly how this will play out in terms of specific regulations, it's safe to say that things are about to get very interesting in the world of online gambling. Casino sites are already starting to gear up for what is sure to be a major influx of new players, and we can expect all sorts of new promotions and bonuses to crop up in the coming weeks and months.

For US players, this is great news as it finally allows us to gamble with real money at reputable and licensed casinos. Aside from a few small states like Nevada and New Jersey, most of us have been relegated to playing at offshore casinos which may or may not be reputable. Not only is this convenient, but it's also often times much safer than playing at an unlicensed site.

Now that things are changing nationwide, we can look forward to a wave of new US-facing casinos popping up over the next year or two. These sites will offer everything from slots and blackjack to poker and sports betting, making it easier than ever for Americans to find their perfect gambling home.

So what does this mean for you? If you're a casino gamer living in the USA, get ready for some serious excitement! Things are about to get a lot more interesting in the world of online gambling, so make sure you keep your eyes peeled for all the latest news and announcements. And most importantly, have fun and good luck!

#  BREAKING: Online Gambling is now LEGAL in the United States!

After years of debate and back-and-forth rulings, online gambling is now legal in the United States. This landmark ruling comes after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey, which legalized online gambling within its borders in 2014.

This is a huge win for casino operators and players alike, as online gambling will now be regulated and taxed in a number of states. This should also help to protect players from shady offshore casinos that do not have the best interests of their customers at heart.

So far, Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey have all moved to regulate online gambling within their borders. Other states are likely to follow suit in the coming months and years.

#  Historic day as online gambling is legalized across America

After months of debate and rigorous campaigning by both Republican and Democrat lawmakers, the historic day has finally arrived as online gambling is legalized across America.

This is a landmark moment for the online gambling industry, as it means that millions of Americans will now be able to access and enjoy regulated online gambling services from the comfort of their own homes.

The passage of this bill has been welcomed by operators and players alike, who believe that it will provide a much-needed boost to the online gambling market in the United States. It is expected that the industry will generate billions of dollars in revenue over the next few years, as more and more Americans sign up for online casinos, poker rooms and other gaming platforms.

This bill comes after many years of legislative wrangling over the legality of online gambling in America. The first attempts to legalize it were made back in 2006, but they failed due to opposition from conservative groups and lobbying from brick-and-mortar casino operators.

However, attitudes towards online gambling have changed in recent years, with many people now seeing it as a legitimate form of entertainment. This was reflected in the recent US Supreme Court ruling which struck down the federal ban on sports betting, paving the way for individual states to legalize it if they choose to do so.

As a result, more than half of US states have now legalized some form of online gambling, with more expected to follow in the coming months and years. This is likely to create a truly nationwide market for online gambling services, which will be worth billions of dollars annually.
