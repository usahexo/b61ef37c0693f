#  Dortmund Shock Chelsea in Champions League

Dortmund managed to pull off one of the biggest upsets in Champions League history on Wednesday night, defeating Chelsea 3-1 at Stamford Bridge.

The Blues went into the game as heavy favourites, but Dortmund were able to take advantage of some poor defending to claim all three points.

It was a particularly impressive victory for Dortmund, as they had lost their last two games in the Champions League and were facing a Chelsea side that had won all four of their Group E matches so far.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave Dortmund the lead in the eighth minute with a superb strike, and Marco Reus doubled their advantage midway through the second half.

Gary Cahill pulled one back for Chelsea in the 79th minute, but Reus scored again in injury time to ensure that Dortmund came away with a shock win.

It was an excellent performance from Dortmund, who looked like a team that genuinely believed they could win the match.

Chelsea were poor throughout and will be bitterly disappointed with their display. They now face an uphill task if they are to qualify for the knockout stages of the competition.

#  Borussia Dortmund Thrash Legia Warsaw 8-4

Borussia Dortmund inflicted an 8-4 defeat on Legia Warsaw in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday night.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was the star of the show for Dortmund, scoring four goals to take his tally for the season to 13 in all competitions.

Ousmane Dembele, Marco Reus and Raphael Guerreiro also found the net for Dortmund, with Michal Pazdan and Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe scoring for Legia.

Dortmund made a flying start to the game and were 3-0 up after just 15 minutes. Aubameyang got them off to a flyer with two goals in quick succession, and Dembele added a third soon after.

Reus made it 4-0 before the break, and Dortmund continued where they left off in the second half with three more goals. Guerreiro got in on the act before Aubameyang completed his hat-trick, and Pazdan’s consolation goal was nothing more than a consolation.

#  Dortmund's Petersen Nets Hat Trick in 4-1 win Over Augsburg

Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a goal and an assist and Dortmund's Christian Pulisic set up two goals as the Bundesliga leader won 4-1 at home to last-place Augsburg on Friday.

Dortmund's Maximilian Philipp opened the scoring in the ninth minute, before Petersen netted a hat trick for his first goals for the club since joining from Werder Bremen in January.

"It was important to win today and it was very nice that I could contribute three goals," said Petersen.

Mario Gomez pulled one back for Augsburg in stoppage time.

#  'Pacemaker' Batshuayi Scores Twice on Dortmund Debut

Michy Batshuayi said he felt like a "pacer" after making a dream debut for Dortmund by scoring twice in Friday's 3-2 Bundesliga win over Cologne.

The Belgian international, who joined Dortmund on loan from Chelsea last month, came off the bench to net either side of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's equaliser and seal victory for the home side.

"I feel like a pacemaker," joked Batshuayi after his double strike.

"I'm very happy that I could score two goals on my debut. It's always good when you can help your new team win.

"It was important to get the three points today."

#  Reus Leads Dortmund to 3-0 Victory Over Gladbach

Borussia Dortmund’s Philipp Reus led the team to a 3-0 victory against Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday.

It was an impressive performance by the 27-year-old, who scored one goal and assisted another in the 38th minute. Dortmund’s Maximilian Philipp also found the back of the net in the first half, scoring in the 17th minute.

Mario Gotze sealed the victory with a goal in the 77th minute, completing a perfect afternoon for Dortmund. The result moves them up to second place in the Bundesliga table, just one point behind current leaders Bayern Munich.

Reus has been in excellent form lately, scoring eight goals in his last eight appearances for club and country. His recent performances have helped him reclaim his spot in Germany’s national team, after being left out of the squad for Euro 2016.

Dortmund will be looking to continue their winning streak when they take on Werder Bremen next weekend.
