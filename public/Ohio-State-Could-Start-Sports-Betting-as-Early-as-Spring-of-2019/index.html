        <h1 id="Ohio-State-Could-Start-Sports-Betting-as-Early-as-Spring-of-2019"><a href="#Ohio-State-Could-Start-Sports-Betting-as-Early-as-Spring-of-2019" class="headerlink" title="Ohio State Could Start Sports Betting as Early as Spring of 2019"></a>Ohio State Could Start Sports Betting as Early as Spring of 2019</h1><p>Ohioans might be able to wager on their favorite sports teams as soon as this spring. That’s because the Ohio State Legislature is considering a bill that would legalize and regulate sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>The bill, House Bill 737, was introduced by Rep. Louis Blessing III of Cincinnati last week. Blessing, a Republican,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> is the primary sponsor of the legislation. It has been referred to the House Committee on Gaming and Wagering.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would allow Ohioans age 21 or older to place bets on professional and collegiate sporting events at licensed betting parlors throughout the state. The bill would also permit online betting through approved websites.</p>
<p>Regulated sports betting is currently legal in only a handful of states, including Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia. However, several other states are considering similar legislation. In recent months, lawmakers in Illinois, Michigan, and New York have introduced bills that would legalize and regulate sports betting in their states.</p>
<p>Supporters of regulated sports betting argue that it would provide a new source of revenue for state governments and create jobs in the gambling industry. They also argue that it would help keep gambling addiction rates in check.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling and other social ills. They also contend that it would damage the integrity of sporting events if they were subject to wagering by fans.</p>
<h1 id="OhioLawmakers-Pushing-to-Allow-Sports-Betting-in-Time-for-the-2019-NFL-Season"><a href="#OhioLawmakers-Pushing-to-Allow-Sports-Betting-in-Time-for-the-2019-NFL-Season" class="headerlink" title="OhioLawmakers Pushing to Allow Sports Betting in Time for the 2019 NFL Season"></a>OhioLawmakers Pushing to Allow Sports Betting in Time for the 2019 NFL Season</h1><p>Ohio lawmakers are preparing a bill that would allow sports betting in the state in time for the upcoming NFL season. This would make Ohio the fifth state to allow such betting, after Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say it could bring in millions of dollars in revenue to the state. They also argue that it would create jobs and help tourism. Detractors say that allowing sports betting could lead to addiction and other social problems.</p>
<p>Ohio is currently one of just six states without any form of legalized gambling. The others are Hawaii, Utah, Alabama, Mississippi, and Idaho.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would allow both in-person and online sports betting. It would also permit bets on college and professional games. The bill has yet to be introduced in the legislature, but is expected to do so soon.</p>
<h1 id="Ohio-Bill-Aims-to-Get-Sports-Betting-up-and-Running-by-Football-Season"><a href="#Ohio-Bill-Aims-to-Get-Sports-Betting-up-and-Running-by-Football-Season" class="headerlink" title="Ohio Bill Aims to Get Sports Betting up and Running by Football Season"></a>Ohio Bill Aims to Get Sports Betting up and Running by Football Season</h1><p>In what would be a major victory for the gambling industry, the state of Ohio is looking to legalize sports betting before football season. The proposed bill looks to create an “integrated gaming control board” to oversee all forms of gambling in the state, including sports betting, online poker, and casino games.</p>
<p>The hope is that this will bring in much-needed revenue to the state, which is facing a budget shortfall of over $800 million. Casino owner Dan Gilbert has already pledged $10 million towards the effort, and other casino operators are expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>There is some opposition to the bill, largely from religious groups who argue that gambling is morally wrong. But with state lawmakers under pressure to find new sources of revenue, it’s likely that the bill will pass.</p>
<p>If it does, Ohio would join a growing number of states that have legalized sports betting in recent years. New Jersey was the first state to do so, followed by Delaware, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. With more states coming on board, it’s only a matter of time before sports betting becomes legal nationwide.</p>
<p>For gamblers, this is good news indeed. Sports betting offers opportunities not available with traditional casino games like blackjack or roulette. You can bet on individual games or on entire seasons, making it possible to win big payouts if you hit the right odds.</p>
<p>And with football season just around the corner, now is the perfect time to get started!</p>
<h1 id="Timeline-for-Ohio-Sports-Betting-Set-Anticipated-Launch-Date-is-September-1"><a href="#Timeline-for-Ohio-Sports-Betting-Set-Anticipated-Launch-Date-is-September-1" class="headerlink" title="Timeline for Ohio Sports Betting Set; Anticipated Launch Date is September 1"></a>Timeline for Ohio Sports Betting Set; Anticipated Launch Date is September 1</h1><p>Ohioans who are looking to bet on sports will soon have the opportunity, as the timeline for the state’s new sports betting program has been announced. The state’s casinos will be allowed to offer sports betting starting on September 1, with online and mobile betting likely to follow at a later date.</p>
<p>The Ohio Casino Control Commission (OCCC) released the timeline for the program this week, specifying that casino operators must apply for permits by August 1. The permits will allow the casinos to offer both in-person and mobile sports betting, with online betting likely to be added at a later date.</p>
<p>The OCCC also specified that sports wagering cannot take place until after 6pm on Sundays, in order to comply with Ohio’s blue laws. In addition, bets cannot be placed on high school or college sporting events taking place in Ohio.</p>
<p>Many of the state’s casinos have already unveiled their plans for sports betting, with most of them opting for an in-person model. Hollywood Casino Columbus has said that it plans to have a “full-service” sportsbook, while Jack Cleveland Casino is planning to offer kiosks where customers can place bets.</p>
<p>Casinos are also anticipating a significant increase in business from sports betting. Hollywood Columbus CEO Kevin Kline said that he expects the casino’s revenue from sports betting to exceed $10 million annually.</p>
<p>The launch of Ohio’s sports betting program is sure to be welcomed by many residents, as recent polling shows that around two-thirds of Ohioans are in favor of it. With legal sports betting now available in a number of states, including neighboring Pennsylvania and Michigan, it is likely that many Ohioans will take advantage of the new option.</p>
<h1 id="Here’s-When-Ohio-Residents-Can-Expect-to-Start-Placing-Bets-on-Their-Favorite-Teams"><a href="#Here’s-When-Ohio-Residents-Can-Expect-to-Start-Placing-Bets-on-Their-Favorite-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Here’s When Ohio Residents Can Expect to Start Placing Bets on Their Favorite Teams"></a>Here’s When Ohio Residents Can Expect to Start Placing Bets on Their Favorite Teams</h1><p>With the NFL season now in full swing, many Ohio residents are looking to place bets on their favorite teams. However, they may not know when they can legally do so. So, when is it legal for Ohioans to bet on the NFL?</p>
<p>In Ohio, betting on the NFL and other professional sports is only legal through state-licensed casinos. This means that residents cannot place bets with online sportsbooks or with bookies. The only way to legally bet on the NFL in Ohio is to head to a casino and make a bet there.</p>
<p>So, when can Ohioans expect to be able to start placing bets at casinos? Well, as of right now, there is no set date for when this will happen. The state has not released any information yet about when they plan to start allowing NFL betting at casinos. However, it is likely that this will happen sometime in the near future.</p>
<p>Until then, Ohio residents will have to wait and see if they can place bets on their favorite teams at their local casino. In the meantime, they can still enjoy watching the games and cheering on their favorite players.</p>
