<h1 id="What-is-it"><a href="#What-is-it" class="headerlink" title="What is it?"></a>What is it?</h1><p>Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto.

<h1 id="What-does-it-cover"><a href="#What-does-it-cover" class="headerlink" title="What does it cover?"></a>What does it cover?</h1><p>Apple’s iPhone has been one of the most popular and successful smartphone devices on the market for many years. However, in recent times there have been reports of waning sales and a slowdown in innovation. In this article, we will take a look at some possible reasons for this, as well as speculating on Apple’s plans for the future.</p>
<h1 id="The-iPhone’s-Dominance"><a href="#The-iPhone’s-Dominance" class="headerlink" title="The iPhone’s Dominance"></a>The iPhone’s Dominance</h1><p>The iPhone has been the best-selling smartphone in the world since 2011, when it overtook Nokia’s Symbian devices. This is largely due to its combination of hardware and software innovation, as well as Apple’s strong branding and marketing.</p>
<p>The iPhone has also consistently been one of the most expensive smartphones on the market, which has helped to maintain its high margin and profitability. In fact, research firm Strategy Analytics estimates that Apple made 92% profit on every iPhone it sold in Q1 2018, compared to just 2% for Samsung.</p>
<h1 id="Falling-Sales"><a href="#Falling-Sales" class="headerlink" title="Falling Sales?"></a>Falling Sales?</h1><p>Despite its continued success, there are some signs that the iPhone may be losing its dominance. For example, research firm IDC reports that global shipments of iPhones declined by 1% in Q4 2017, while Gartner estimates that they will decline by 8% in 2018.</p>
<p>This may be due to a number of factors, such as increasing competition from Android devices, customer fatigue with incremental updates to the iPhone design, or simply rising prices. It is also worth noting that China - an important market for Apple - is currently going through a slowdown in economic growth.</p>
<h1 id="The-Future-of-the-iPhone"><a href="#The-Future-of-the-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="The Future of the iPhone"></a>The Future of the iPhone</h1><p>Apple has not yet released any information about its plans for the future of the iPhone, so speculation is rampant. Some believe that Apple will release a more affordable version of the iPhone aimed at developing markets such as India and China. Others believe that Apple will release a foldable phone or even move towards all-screen designs like those found on rivals such as Samsung and Huawei.</p>
<h1 id="How-often-does-it-post-new-content"><a href="#How-often-does-it-post-new-content" class="headerlink" title="How often does it post new content?"></a>How often does it post new content?</h1><p>In order to determine how often a site posts new content, you’ll need to first find out when the last post was made. You can do this by using a search engine to find the site’s home page, then locating the most recent post. Once you have that date, subtract it from the current date to find out how long it’s been since the last post was made.</p>
<p>To figure out how often the site posts new content, divide that number by the number of days in that time period. So if it’s been two weeks since the last post on a website, and there are 30 days in February, then the site posts new content every two days on average. </p>
<p>If you’re looking for an even more specific answer, you can also look at how many posts were made in that time period. Divide the number of posts in that time period by the number of days in that time period to get an average post frequency.</p>
