The online poker giant PokerStars has announced that it will be sponsoring and dealing the action in Event #1: €1,100 No Limit Hold’em.</p>
<p>In total, PokerStars will deal 900,000 hands across 15 events at WSOPE, which is a significant increase over last year’s numbers. With so much action taking place on their virtual felt, players can rest assured that they will have plenty of opportunities to get in on the action at one of the world’s most prestigious live poker festivals.</p>
<p>While the $10 million guaranteed prize pool for the Main Event is certainly an attractive carrot for players, there are many other reasons to make the trip to Rozvadov this fall. In addition to all of the cash games and side events that will be running around the clock, there is also a casino and spa on site for those looking to take a break from the tables. And for those who like to mix things up a bit, Prague – one of Europe’s most beautiful cities – is just a short train ride away.</p>
<p>Players looking to satellite into WSOPE events can do so on PokerStars starting at as little as $0.55 or by winning their way in through one of several live satellites taking place in casinos across Europe. With over 35 events planned and a wide range of buy-ins available, there is something for everyone at this year’s WSOPE. Be sure to visit PokerStarsWSOP.com for more information and to reserve your spot today!</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Plans-to-Deal-Millions-of-Hands-in-October"><a href="#PokerStars-Plans-to-Deal-Millions-of-Hands-in-October" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Plans to Deal Millions of Hands in October"></a>PokerStars Plans to Deal Millions of Hands in October</h1><p>PokerStars officials announced on Wednesday that the world’s largest online poker site plans to deal an astounding 25 million hands during October.</p>
<p>That figure is a far cry from the site’s busiest month on record, which took place in March of this year when PokerStars dealt just over 14 million hands.</p>
<p>What’s behind the sudden surge in action? Officials believe that it has to do with the upcoming World Series of Poker, which kicks off next week at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“With the WSOP right around the corner, we expect a lot of players will be turning to PokerStars to get their fill of big-money tournament action,” said PokerStars spokesperson Anastasia Danelyan.</p>
<p>Indeed, many of the most prestigious events on the WSOP schedule – including the $10,000 Main Event – will take place in the latter half of July and early August. That should provide plenty of incentive for players from all over the world to fire up their PokerStars accounts and log some serious volume.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the increased traffic, PokerStars has beefed up its software infrastructure by adding additional servers and increasing its pool of manpower. The site is also offering a range of promotions and bonuses specifically geared towards WSOP participants.</p>
<p>Among other things, PokerStars is running a series of ‘challenges’ that award prizes worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars to players who achieve specific goals such as winning a certain number of hands or reaching a certain final table stage. There are also reload bonuses available for those looking to add some extra funds to their bankrolls.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Get started now and see if you can take down one of PokerStars’ coveted challenges!</p>
