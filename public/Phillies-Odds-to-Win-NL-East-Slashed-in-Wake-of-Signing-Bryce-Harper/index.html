      Phillies Odds to Win NL East Slashed in Wake of Signing Bryce Harper

<p>Bovada has the Phillies’ odds at 5/2, down from 7/2 before Harper’s signing.</p>
<p>According to Oddschecker, other major sportsbooks have also lowered the Phillies’ odds, with some going as low as 2/1.</p>
<p>The Nationals are still the favorites to win the NL East, with 7/4 odds, followed by the Braves at 5/1. The Mets are next at 10/1, and the Marlins are last at 100/1.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Harper’s signing impacts the Eagles’ betting odds for Super Bowl LIII. The defending champions currently have 5/1 odds to repeat, but that could change now that Philadelphia has added one of the best players in baseball.</p>
<h1 id="Braves-Poised-to-Make-a-Run-at-NL-East-Crown-With-Young-Stars-on-the-Rise"><a href="#Braves-Poised-to-Make-a-Run-at-NL-East-Crown-With-Young-Stars-on-the-Rise" class="headerlink" title="Braves Poised to Make a Run at NL East Crown With Young Stars on the Rise"></a>Braves Poised to Make a Run at NL East Crown With Young Stars on the Rise</h1><p>The Braves surprised many this past season by competing for the NL East title until the final days of the year. They ultimately finished just short, but their future looks bright with a young nucleus of players led by Freddie Freeman, Ender Inciarte, Ozzie Albies, and Ronald Acuna.</p>
<p>The front office did a nice job of supplementing that core this winter, adding veterans Brian McCann and Josh Donaldson to help lead the way. Those two join Freeman and Inciarte as holdovers from Atlanta’s last playoff team in 2013.</p>
<p>McCann is coming off a down year in Houston but he’s still one of the most respected catchers in the game and has plenty of playoff experience. Donaldson was an MVP candidate as recently as 2016 and provides a much-needed middle-of-the-order bat.</p>
<p>Atlanta’s rotation is also underrated, headlined by young stars Julio Teheran and Mike Foltynewicz. Sean Newcomb, Max Fried, Kyle Wright, and Bryse Wilson all offer upside as well and should continue to develop under new pitching coach Rick Knapp.</p>
<p>This team is definitely capable of making a run at the playoffs in 2019. The Nationals are still the favorites in the NL East but the Braves are definitely worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<h1 id="Nationals-Still-Favored-to-Win-NL-East-Despite-Bryce-Harper’s-Departure"><a href="#Nationals-Still-Favored-to-Win-NL-East-Despite-Bryce-Harper’s-Departure" class="headerlink" title="Nationals Still Favored to Win NL East, Despite Bryce Harper’s Departure"></a>Nationals Still Favored to Win NL East, Despite Bryce Harper’s Departure</h1><p>The Washington Nationals are still the favorites to win the National League East division, even after losing Bryce Harper in free agency.</p>
<p>The Nationals have a very talented roster, headlined by Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg. They also have a strong lineup, which includes Trea Turner, Anthony Rendon, and Juan Soto.</p>
<p>Washington was able to re-sign Ryan Zimmerman and Matt Adams, which should help offset the loss of Harper.</p>
<p>The Atlanta Braves are considered the #2 team in the NL East, and they made some major upgrades this offseason by signing Josh Donaldson and Brian McCann. The Philadelphia Phillies are also a potential threat, as they have a young roster that is loaded with talent.</p>
<p>However, at the end of the day, the Nationals are still the favorites to win the division and they should be able to compete for a World Series title this season.</p>
<h1 id="Mets-Look-to-Bounce-Back-and-Win-NL-East-in-2019"><a href="#Mets-Look-to-Bounce-Back-and-Win-NL-East-in-2019" class="headerlink" title="Mets Look to Bounce Back and Win NL East in 2019"></a>Mets Look to Bounce Back and Win NL East in 2019</h1><p>After a disappointing 2018 season, the Mets are looking to rebound in a big way in 2019. Riding the wave of optimism brought on by new manager Carlos Beltran and some key offseason acquisitions, the Mets believe they can win the NL East this year.</p>
<p>The biggest addition for the Mets this offseason was Robinson Cano, who joined the team after being traded from the Mariners. Cano is one of the best hitters in baseball and is coming off a season in which he hit .303 with 23 homers and 103 RBI. He should provide an immediate boost to the Mets lineup.</p>
<p>New York also made a few other key additions this offseason, including Jed Lowrie, Wilson Ramos and Edwin Diaz. Lowrie is an All-Star shortstop who gives the Mets much-needed depth at that position, while Ramos is one of the best catchers in baseball and Diaz is one of the best closers in baseball. All three players should make a major impact for New York this season.</p>
<p>In addition to their offseason additions, the Mets will also have some familiar faces returning from injury. ace pitcher Noah Syndergaard is expected to be back at full strength after missing significant time last season with injuries, and slugger Yoenis Cespedes is also expected to return after missing most of last season with various injuries.</p>
<p>Overall, there is plenty of reason for optimism among Mets fans heading into 2019. The team looks poised to make a run at winning their first NL East title since 2006.</p>
<h1 id="Phillies-and-Braves-Battle-it-Out-for-the-Lead-in-the-NL-East"><a href="#Phillies-and-Braves-Battle-it-Out-for-the-Lead-in-the-NL-East" class="headerlink" title="Phillies and Braves Battle it Out for the Lead in the NL East"></a>Phillies and Braves Battle it Out for the Lead in the NL East</h1><p>The Phillies and Braves sit atop the NL East as they battle for the division lead. The Phillies have opened up a three-game lead, but the Braves are not giving up without a fight.</p>
<p>The Braves have won nine of their last ten games to close the gap. Freddie Freeman has been on a tear, hitting .476 with six home runs and 16 RBI over that span. Ozzie Albies has also been hot, hitting .415 with six homers and 16 RBI.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Phillies have relied on their pitching staff to carry them. Aaron Nola has been the ace of the staff, going 6-1 with a 2.27 ERA. Jake Arrieta has also pitched well, going 3-2 with a 3.49 ERA.</p>
<p>The two teams will meet for a three-game series this weekend in Philadelphia. This could be a preview of the NLDS in October.</p>
